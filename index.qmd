Hi! I'm Anna! I'm currently a second year Environmental Studies student at UCSB looking to research agro-ecology professionally. I'm originally from Seattle, but have been loving the Califonria sun since I first arrived. In my free time you can find me outdoors climbing or backpacking, or spending a rainy day inside crocheting. Stick around to find out more!
