Hi! I'm Anna! I'm currently finishing out my second year as an Environmental Studies (BS) student at UCSB looking to enter the field of agro-ecology and forestry professionally. I'm originally from Seattle, but have been loving the California sun since I first arrived. In my free time you can find me outdoors climbing or backpacking, or spending a rainy day inside crocheting or making New York Times Cooking recipes. Also, I generally prefer dogs to people, but I occasionally make exceptions. Stick around to find out more!
