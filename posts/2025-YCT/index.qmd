Welcome to my first blog post!

This is where I'll share updates about my work with YCT on the Elings Valerio Trail project.

## YCT at UCSB

Your Children's Trees is a student community-based non-profit organization founded in coordination with the UCSB organization of the same name for the care of Santa Barbara County's urban forests. Planting trees in our cities helps bring back nature and provides many other benefits such as urban beautification, increasing property values, cleaning the air, and controlling water runoff. Your Children's Trees works to keep our urban forests healthy by planting and caring for trees in public areas such as schools and parks. We also undertake various educational pursuits such as participating in science nights at local elementary schools and conducting environmental restoration plantings in ecological reserves. It's important that we take care of the trees around us. These are not just our trees, but your children's trees.

## Elings Park Project

At 230 acres, Santa Barbara’s Elings Park is the largest community-supported non-profit public park in America, and provides year-round recreation for more than 200,000 visitors annually. They rely on user fees and public donations to keep everything running smoothly and making any improvements to the park.

### Santa Barbara Foundation Growing Grounds- An Oak Nursery

The Growing Grounds is a nursery for raising native California oak trees from acorns gathered within the Park, and a partnership with Santa Barbara Foundation, Your Children’s Trees (US!), and Channel Islands Restoration. They are located near the far end of the Administration parking lot, adjacent to the West Valerio Street pedestrian entrance. The seedlings are cared for by YCT interns and volunteers, including UCSB students, Park neighbors, and youth from the Alternatives to Violence Program. The overarching goal is to plant 400 trees total, giving ample shade to the nine miles of trails within the Park, beginning with live coast oaks along the Valerio Trail.

### The Vision

More than 40 years ago, the founders of Elings Park had a unique vision for this spectacular site: to provide recreational facilities in an exceptional setting for the benefit of all citizens of the Santa Barbara area. It started out as the Santa Barbara landfill, and has now been completely transformed into a park unrecognizable from its humble beginnings. As part of their plan, they insisted that the park would be created, maintained and operated without the use of a single taxpayer dollar.

From the park’s beginnings in 1965, its founders – under the leadership of Jerry Harwin – knew this spot halfway between Goleta and Carpinteria would be ideal for the recreational needs of a highly active community.

Today the Elings Park Foundation provides a place for sports and athletic endeavors for people of all ages, from all neighborhoods, and from all walks of life. It also serves as a model for other communities, demonstrating that a non-profit foundation can operate an extraordinary park without the need for government funds.

### The Plan

A grant proposal was submitted in 2024 to the Santa Barbara Foundation which included the following information:

#### Project Description:

In 1995, Elings purchased 120 acres of land south of the original park which had been used for decades for dry farming and had been largely denuded of vegetation. The request for the 2025 CEPT grant is a logical extension of the 2024 CEPT Grant to begin planting the trees grown at Elings Growing Grounds in Elings Park. We will continue the partnership with Channel Islands Restoration (CIR) in a two-part project to plant native shade trees along Elings trails, and to plant a Torrey Pine refuge in Elings Park. YCT will use native coast live oak trees from the growing grounds and plant them in 20’ increments along the adjacent Valerio Trail, which climbs a steep hill with a number of switchbacks and currently has no shade or canopy coverage. YCT and Elings’ volunteers will first clear the vegetation in the surrounding area. Then, we will plant 80 coast live oaks along the more than 1300’ trail, accompanied by the installation of 8 timer-regulated drip irrigation systems. CIR will use the same main irrigation line as YCT to extend the irrigation system to the Elings South Mesa to plant 86 torrey pine trees from the Elings nursery. CIR will extend drip irrigation to each of the trees using multiple timer regulators as needed depending upon available water pressure. CIR and YCT will work together to add buffer native trees surrounding the Torrey pine area using joint staff, interns, and volunteers.

#### Project Goal:

The primary YCT project goal is to successfully establish a canopy of coast live oak trees along the trails at Elings Park, starting with the Valerio Trail. By planting 80 trees along the trail, the project aims to establish a long-term canopy coverage shade that does not currently exist. It will also offer environmental and recreational benefits to the park's visitors and wildlife inhabitants. This approach is optimal because it builds on the existing infrastructure and resources of Elings Park's growing grounds. Trees will be sourced from the onsite growing grounds since they will have been accustomed to the climatic conditions in this area, increasing their chances of surviving after transplantation. Additionally, the use of interns and volunteers for vegetation clearing and tree planting promotes community involvement and reduces project costs.The primary CIR project goal is to establish a refuge of torrey pine trees to act as a source of native torrey pine trees in anticipation of the original source area becoming less appropriate due to climate change. The pines project seeks to replicate an environment that encourages natural reproduction of the most endangered tree in North America. Some of this will occur from planting companion plants found growing in the existing populations. This is the best approach for the CIR project because of the known increase in temperature changes over the next several decades due to climate change. CIR anticipates that the native range of torrey pines currently in the San Diego area, over time, may become unsuitable for the pines to reproduce themselves. CIR chose Santa Barbara due to it being a coastal community over 200 miles north, which will have a climate well-suited to the pines for many decades into the future.

#### How will this project provide a community benefit or an ecological, aesthetic, or other improvement?

For the YCT portion of the project, the establishment of a larger presence of trees along trails at Elings Park will firstly provide extensive canopy coverage along these trails, as coast live oaks can span up to 40’ or more at full maturity, decreasing the risk of heat-related illnesses during recreation. Furthermore, it provides additional aesthetic value to the trail system, contributing to Elings Park’s appeal as a natural green space for community use. The ecological improvement is itself the establishment of coast live oak trees along these trails. The same shade provided by these trees to moderate local temperatures also helps with water retention. The trees will help stabilize the soil on the steep hillside, reducing erosion and promoting healthier vegetation in the surrounding area. This also creates a baseline for establishing an entire oak woodland region, one of the most ecologically diverse native communities in Santa Barbara county. For the CIR portion of the project, the torrey pines act as a safeguard to protect the native torrey pine viability, as shade for visitors, and as an educational resource to convey the effects of climate change. We will also be installing interpretive signage explaining and educating the park's visitors.

#### If there is an immediate/urgent need for this project, explain why:

For the YCT portion of the project, the urgency lies in the climate resilience aspect of this project. Like most other trees, coast live oaks sequester carbon dioxide throughout the span of their lifetimes and contribute to local temperature moderation. These oaks in particular also excel at tackling conditions in the Santa Barbara region, being drought resilient and able to handle high temperature extremes—both of which are to be expected with the present onset of climate change. However, these trees can take decades to fully mature, making it imperative to begin as soon as now. The weather extremes introduced by climate change also impact visitor recreation, making it more difficult to stay safe from heat-related illnesses, especially on the completely exposed trails throughout the park. Planting trees now ensures that future visitors will be protected by canopy shade in light of rising temperature highs. For the CIR portion of the project, climate change is affecting us now and it takes years to plant and grow trees to maturity. These torrey pines will, like the coast live oaks and other trees, sequester carbon dioxide throughout the span of their lifetimes and contribute to local temperature moderation. CIR needs to start now to create an environment where the future of the Pinus torreyana species is maintained. Additionally, the trees intended for this project are currently in the growing grounds and are ready for planting. Timing is crucial for ensuring their successful adaptation to the new location. If delayed, the trees might outgrow their containers, reducing their chances of thriving once planted. Action within the next year will ensure the trees are planted at the optimal stage of growth, maximizing their survival and long-term contribution to the park.

### Why Coast Live Oaks?

Quercus agrifolia, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a resilient evergreen oak native to California, particularly common in the Santa Monica Mountains and coastal regions up to 5,000 feet in elevation. It thrives in canyons, near creeks, and shaded plant communities. These trees can live up to 300 years, grow 30–75 feet tall, and develop sprawling crowns up to 130 feet wide. Their distinctive limbs often grow in unpredictable directions, and they transition from a deep taproot to horizontal roots as they mature to optimize water access. The tough, leathery, and often convex leaves help the tree conserve water by capturing dew and mist—an important trait in drought-prone areas. The leaves adapt in thickness and shape depending on light exposure, maximizing photosynthesis and protection against herbivory. As they age, the bark develops deep furrows, aiding in water retention and providing additional fire resistance. Coast live oaks are remarkably fire-resistant. Their thick bark insulates vital tissues from heat, and the trees can often survive and resprout after wildfires. Their ability to retain moisture through leaves and roots helps slow the spread of flames. Additionally, their evergreen foliage reduces the accumulation of dry, combustible leaf litter on the ground. Historically, the Chumash people relied heavily on these trees, especially their acorns, which were harvested, dried, ground into flour, and leached of tannins to create nourishing foods like mush, bread, or drinks. Oak bark served as prized firewood, while various parts of the tree were used for tools, medicine, musical instruments, and even sunscreen. Today, coast live oaks face threats from climate change, drought, fire, disease, and urban development—but their fire-adaptive traits remain key to their survival in fire-prone landscapes.

### Current Update

As of right now, 75 out of the 80 trees have been planted along the Elings Valerio trail, with the last 5 to be planted in the following week or two, which is largely due to a volunteer event we held at the park on Wednesday May 14, where 150 Deckers employees from all over the country came to participate in planting. Two people were assigned to a tree plot and they made quick work of the planting, only leaving the final touches to YCT, including adding additional mulch on top and adjusting anything that may have been off at each site.
