I’m originally from Seattle, but have been loving the California sun since I first arrived. In my free time you can find me outdoors climbing, backpacking, scuba diving or enjoying live music, or spending a rainy day inside crocheting and making New York Times Cooking recipes. Also, I generally prefer dogs to people, but I occasionally make exceptions. Stick around to find out more!"
