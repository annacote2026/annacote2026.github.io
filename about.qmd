# Rocks, rocks, and more rocks
I started bouldering indoors about 2 and a half years, and since being introduced to it have not been able to stop. I now climb outside any chance I get, and have had the privilege to climb in some amazing places such as Banff National Park and Ten Sleep Canyon in Wyoming. Last summer my boyfriend and I took a road trip and he taught me to multi-pitch along the way, broadening what I thought rock climbing could be, and allowing me to get in touch with myself in an exciting yet terrifying way.

# UCSB Ski and Snowboard Team
I spend the majority of my weekends during the winter traveling to Mammoth or other local resorts for ski competition trips! Since retiring from competitive soccer after high school, I have needed to get involved in something that ignites that side of myself, and I found it in racing. Although I have been skiing for my whole life, it has always been very casual, going up a few weekends every season, so it has been great to push myself to improve and get more days on the mountain, all while being with my best friends.

# SCUBA

I received my Open Water SCUBA Certification in the Winter of my Freshman year, which I credit with opening up the world of marine science to me. I originally took the course in hopes of being able to dive with my mom one day and because we are in the perfect place for such a sport, but it has now seeped into my life in some pretty big ways. I currently intern for the Miller Lab here on campus, where I train an AI software called ViQi to identify benthic organisms, and I hope to be able to get my Scientific Diving Certification next year so I can be the one taking the photos underwater which I have been studying for the past year!
